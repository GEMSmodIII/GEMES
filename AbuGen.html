			Genesis L. Jones was born in September 13 1995. Her passion for technology developed in her childhood years. She love to take things apart with her hands. Even as a child, Genesis was fascinated with the process of troubleshooting and solving the mystery of successfully putting things back together. During those years, she created train tracks from the broken parts of her motherâ€™s computer. However, these were not just any train tracks. These tracks led her to grow the ability to stay motivated through self-educating. Further, it was one of the beginning moments that has driven her to analyze, create and execute projects effectively. As she grew older, she became more fascinated about planes and other crafts. While researching the aeronautical industry, she discovered that technology is required to build many of the most fascinating aircrafts. This research helped to fuel her interest in technology even more. She learned how IT is present in many other industries including gaming, animation, web design, and engineering.
