       "The opportunity for success does not come around every often for most people. For me it is like seeing a solar elcipse or like playing hide and seek. Before I joined Year Up, I had no idea where my life was taking me. I had no steady career path and did not know what I wanted to do with my life. After joining Year Up, I finally found something I was interested in. I chose a career that I know that I will be proud of and work toward being a PC Technician. Year Up was not only a program that helped me choose my career path, it became a life style change for me. It changed the way I talked, think, and my life as a whole. I am proud of the person that I have become and I plan to never look back. Now that I have the tools to become a professional in anything I want to do in life. Year Up was truly a diamond in rough and I am glad that I did not give up on this wonderful opportunity."

        "I was presented with the opportunity htrough seeking a job online on craigslist. When I came across Year Up it sounded like a great oppurtunity and something familiar that a friend had once mentioned to me. As soon as I filled out the interest form for the program; I asked my friend what was the name of the organization he had mentioned to me once and surprisingly it was Year Up. I was happy to know that I would now be in the enrolling process for such a beneficial program. Year Up has helped me explore a new field  that I had never thought og learning. I plan to focus of Marketing and Sales for my career path and also using the fundamentals of Information Technology to expand my growth within this career."
